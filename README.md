# jENDGAME
Analysis and port of the ENDGAME exploit for Xbox Classic.

The objective of this repository is to translate the ENDGAME exploit in the repository https://github.com/XboxDev/endgame-exploit and try to understand its behavior even when Java does not have low-level hardware management capabilities.

# Thank you for the work of:
* shutterbug (<a href="https://twitter.com/shutterbug20002">@hutterbug2000</a>), discovery and initial exploitation efforts
* Markus Gaasedelen (<a href="https://twitter.com/gaasedelen">@gaasedelen</a>), root-cause-analysis & ENDGAME development
* xbox7887 (<a href="https://twitter.com/xbox7887">@xbox7887</a>), minor contributions and assistance with testing

# Notes
* Continue searching for a usable loophole for Xbox 360 or an attack vector that enables homebrew without the need for RGH and LTU#
